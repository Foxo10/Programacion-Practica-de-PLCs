NOMADIC USE OF SFCEDIT

By default, the software uses the Windows Registry to keep the configuration parameters (like fonts, colors ...).
For a nomadic use of the software, from an USB key for example, you can specify that the parameters are kept in a file.
To do this, simply copy the attached file SFCEDIT.INI in the same directory as the executable SFCEDIT.EXE
So your settings will be retained regardless of the computer running the software.
